Directions: You are going to read a passage with 10 statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter.
The Courage to Know Oneself
 

A) I have had a lot of fear in my life. Much of the fear started when I was about nine years old and developed into an unbearable fear of dying. I would lie in bed at night, knowing that I was eventually going to lose everything I owned. Then I cherished life itself very much. “Why was I born if only to die?” was the question that plagued me. I literally could not sleep at night. And I could find no comfort from either of my parents. So I learned to deal with it by controlling my breath (I thought if I kept breathing, I would stay alive). This habitual activity deadened (使麻木) my spontaneity and inner freedom for decades to come.
 

B) This issue wasn’t resolved until I finally faced death directly within myself and saw what I was really afraid of was not death, but aloneness – existential aloneness – being all alone forever. And when I opened to this aloneness, needing to know what it really was, my consciousness opened to my wholeness and my interconnectedness with all existence. And I have not been lonely or afraid in the way I used to be since that defining moment.
 

C) This story exemplifies the underlying principle of courage. Having courage does not mean that one does not have fear. It means that one is willing to face fear – to face fear itself in order to know the truth about something. In a very real sense, one could say that fear is the separation from the truth, and that courage is the willingness to go through fear to get to the truth. All fears, then, refer back to the one fear that is our separation from the truth of who and what we really are – our true nature, our undivided and interconnected self.
 

D) The word “courage” comes from Latin and French derivatives that mean “heart”. So when people ask me what courage is, I often tell them that it is heart-work, learning how to move through fear.
 

E) Every little fear becomes a doorway to a larger, less fearful part of ourselves, if we can just allow ourselves to be open and vulnerable to it, curious about it – needing to understand it and having to know the truth. Every time we face a fear, we learn that we have the ability to move through fear, we become a little more courageous in our lives, and we get a little closer to the truth.
 

F) I often say that the difference between a child and an adult is that the child retreats from fear – chooses to stay stuck in their fear of the fear whereas the adult faces fear – chooses to move through their fear of the fear, into and through the fear itself.
 

G) So, in order to fully understand courage, we need to understand why we would choose to not face our fear, but to continue to be afraid of it. Why would we choose to stay stuck in a limited, tight, fearful place when we could be free and open and joyous?
 

H) This, of course, is a huge question. But I think there are a few key things we can see that will be very useful. The first question that arises in this inquiry is, “What is it that we’re really afraid of, anyway?”
 

I) There’s an old Jewish expression that translates roughly into “Don’t look too deep”. I think the expression is based on the belief that what is deepest inside of us is fundamentally not good – original sin (罪恶), the id, etc. So, if one should sincerely seek the truth, what he will ultimately discover is that one’s true nature is bad. And how could one live with that knowledge? And so we are afraid of looking into things for fear that we won’t like what we find. From my experience, however, what I have found to be deepest inside myself (and all beings) is pure love, compassion, wisdom, and understanding. It’s just a matter of looking deeply enough to see what’s there.
 

J) We are also afraid of letting go of the known – what we have known. Even though we may be aware of our suffering, at least we are familiar with it. We may even have become comfortable with it in a peculiar sort of way. We have made a kind of pact with our suffering: “I won’t bother challenging you if you promise not to get any worse.” In essence, we are afraid to change because we have an unconscious belief that things will get worse if we let go of what we know. What I have learned, however, is that the only place where there is true peace is in the place of absolute letting go of what we have known. From this place, I am able to respond freely and directly to the circumstances of my life.
 

K) We have taken on an identity, an image, a set of beliefs about what we and the surrounding world are all about. We see our lives through this set of beliefs. If we were to let go of these ideas about what reality is, we are afraid we would no longer know what is real. And that is a frightening prospect for us. We are afraid that our world would be chaotic and even terrifying. We are afraid that the universe is not a benevolent (慈善的) place.
 

L) And so we cling desperately to a set of beliefs about who we are and what the world is. All the beliefs were created (primarily in an attempt to protect ourselves from experiencing pain) very early in our childhood, and are buried deep in our subconscious. These beliefs or self-images serve to separate us from the reality and are actually the source of all our fears and all our sufferings. It is only by challenging or inquiring into these beliefs that we can move through our fears and come to know our true, courageous, free, open, loving, and peaceful self. The great poet, Rainer Maria Rilke once said, “The spiritual path is one of being defeated by greater and greater beings.” In the process of inquiring into, seeing into and letting go of our false selves, one’s awareness opens increasingly to the beauty and awe that is always present.
 

M) One could then say that courage is being more committed to knowing the truth than protecting one’s cherished ideas and images about oneself and the world. What beliefs do you cling to? And are you courageous enough to challenge them?

11)The author, based on his experience, believes that what lies the deepest inside of human beings is nothing but good qualities.
12)If we can absolutely let go of what we have know, we can find a place where there is true peace.
13)Kids and grown-ups respond differently in the face of fear.
14)Deeply-rooted in our mind since childhood, the beliefs about who we are and what the world is separate us from the reality and cause all our fears and sufferings.
15)What really frightened the author was the loneliness rather than death itself.
16)We are unwilling to change in life because we are preoccupied with the belief that things will change for the worse if we let go of what we have known.
17)Facing fears can make us less fearful, more courageous and more likely to get to the truth.
18)We are afraid that we would be thrown into a chaotic and terrifying world if we give up the set of our beliefs.
19)Ever since childhood, the author has been subject to intense and irrational fear of dying.
20)Courage means the willingness to conquer fear to get to the truth.
阅读理解10题，总分值：20分
Directions: Read the following passages carefully. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished sentences. For each of them there are four choices marked A, B, C, and D. Choose the best answer to each question.
Most people would be impressed by the high quality of medicine available to most Americans. There are a lot of specialization, a great deal of attention to the individual, a vast amount of advanced technical equipment, and intense effort not to make mistakes because of the financial risk which doctors and hospitals must face in the courts if they handle things badly.
 

But the Americans are in a mess. The problem is the way in which health care is organized and financed. Contrary to public belief it is not just a free competition system. The private system has been joined by a large public system, because private care was simply not looking after the less fortunate and the elderly.
 

But even with this huge public part of the system, which this year will eat up 84.5 billion dollars — more than 10 percent of the US budget — large numbers of Americans are left out. These include about half the 11 million unemployed and those who fail to meet the strict limits on income fixed by a government trying to make savings where it can.
 

The basic problem, however, is that there is no central control over the health system. There is no limit to what doctors and hospitals charge for their services, other than what the public is able to pay. The number of doctors has shot up and prices have climbed. When faced with toothache, a sick child, or a heart attack, all the unfortunate person concerned can do is to pay up. Two-thirds of the population are covered by medical insurance. Doctors charge as much as they want knowing that the insurance company will pay the bill.
 

The rising cost of medicine in the US is among the most worrying problems facing the country. In 2010 the country’s health bill climbed 15.9 percent — about twice as fast as prices in general.

21)
Why does the high quality of medicine available to most Americans impress most people deeply according to the passage?
  A. Because doctors and hospitals need a lot of specialization and attentions.
  B. Because doctors and hospitals can avoid any mistake and possible financial risk.
  C. Because doctors and hospitals have to do a lot to protect themselves from legal cases.
  D. Because doctors and hospitals have provided a lot of services.
22)
What does the author mean by saying “the Americans are in a mess”?
  A. The public system coexists with the private system.
  B. The private system has more influence than the public system.
  C. The problem lies in the fact that public system is not a free competition system.
  D. There is something wrong with the way health care is organized and financed.
23)
Who benefit least from this public part of the medical system?
  A. Some of the unemployed and those who can’t meet the limits on income.
  B. The employed and those who meet the basic limits on income
  C. Most unemployed Americans who fail to meet the limits on savings.
  D. The 11 million unemployed who fail to meet the limits on income.
24)
The medical problems can be possibly solved by ______________.
  A. making full use of the insurance company
  B. limiting the number of doctors
  C. controlling the health system effectively
  D. charging the patients as little as possible
25)
The author’s tone in this passage is ____________.
  A. doubtful
  B. critical
  C. sympathetic
  D. objective
Starvation is the most fearful and the most dreaded of all the anxieties that haunt (萦绕) the minds and the imaginations of mankind. Mankind’s every effort has been directed to combat it and will continue to do so until the end of time. Its prevention has been the greatest motivation that ever kept men braced up in the struggle. It is the real enemy. Yet like every other enemy its presence brings forth the best that is in us and urges us to do greater things in the struggle. In the continuous fight against hunger and cold, man has progressed wonderfully and done more than what was absolutely necessary to merely guard against starvation. His future progress can only be made through keeping up the fight.
 

The fight is the same now as it was when our early ancestor struggled with some living things and with their flesh satisfying his inward desire and with their skin keeping out the cold so that he might live, and for the time being to keep the anxiety at bay. The forces we have to fight now are different, but the struggle is the same. As he succeeded in conquering his victim to make his existence secure, so must we conquer the forces that are opposed to us or we will perish. Unlike our early ancestor, whose task is simple in the struggle for existence, we have to fight not only the natural conditions, but artificial ones which society has created.
 

In the struggle we have conquered as far as getting enough to eat and enough to wear is concerned, for we have produced both in abundance and far in excess of what our necessities require. Foodstuffs are gathered and harvested every year in quantities so great that their consumption would be impossible. Various clothing material is manufactured in such quantities that nakedness should have become impossible. We have achieved so much in providing food and clothing that it is strange that some are still hovering on the brink of starvation. Productivity is continuously increasing and the quality of production is continually improving. Yet with all this we are haunted by starvation. Its dread presence is ever felt.

26)
In the sentence “… that ever kept men braced up in the struggle” (Paragraph One), the underlined phrase means _____.
  A. bound up
  B. depressed
  C. cheered up
  D. secured
27)
From the first paragraph, we learn that _____.
  A. mankind keeps fighting only for more food to meet their needs
  B. mankind has been on the brink of starvation all the time
  C. mankind has progressed a lot in the struggle against starvation
  D. mankind won’t win the battle against starvation
28)
We have more difficulties in the struggle against starvation, because _____.
  A. we have to make more people’s existence secure
  B. the natural conditions are worsening all the time
  C. we are confronted with different kinds of starvations
  D. our conditions are more complicated than before
29)
What do we learn from the passage about the supply of food and clothing now?
  A. We have enough food, but some are still naked.
  B. We have insufficient food and enough clothing materials.
  C. We have already produced sufficient food and clothing materials.
  D. People should produce more food and clothes to satisfy themselves.
30)
We are still haunted by starvation probably because _____.
  A. population growth is too fast
  B. The productivity is continuously getting lower.
  C. quality of what we produce is inferior
  D. There may be some other problems with mankind.
