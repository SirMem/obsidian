Thanks for enrolling in my course _Analytic Combinatorics_. You can review [the syllabus](https://www.coursera.org/learn/analytic-combinatorics/resources/2GZLL) and [schedule](https://www.coursera.org/learn/analytic-combinatorics/resources/jjWEG) to see what's coming. I'll also send weekly announcements summarizing what's to happen each week. The course is based on a variety of materials:

â€¢ The lecture videos and lecture slides.

â€¢ The textbook _Analytic Combinatorics_, our basic reference. Although the lectures are designed to be self-contained, the textbook provides thorough coverage of the material.

â€¢ The booksite [http://ac.cs.princeton.edu/home/](http://ac.cs.princeton.edu/home/), which is open to everyone and contains a wealth of supplementary information, including synopses of the textbook, answers to some exercises, code, and other resources. In particular, it is a good idea to bookmark [http://ac.cs.princeton.edu/errata/](http://ac.cs.princeton.edu/errata/) to keep track of corrections to errors in the course materials that people have found in the past (and to submit any that you might find!).

â€¢ Selected exercises from the textbook, which are presented as an ungraded practice quiz at the end of the lecture. These are for self-assessment and to focus discussion in the forums. Not everyone is expected to successfully complete every question---some of them are quite challenging and may be difficult for some people to complete on their own.

â€¢ Optional experiments, usually introduced in the lecture slides and also released each week in the booksite and the Coursera site. Again, these are for self-assessment and to focus discussion in the forums.

â€¢ Graded quizzes. Each lecture ends with a graded quiz consisting of a few multiple-choice questions. Some of the questions are fact-based and may require review of the lecture; others require derivations and calculations similar to those presented in lectures.

To maximize your learning outcome in this course, you should get in the mindset of being an active participant who solves problems, studies the available resources, engages in the discussion forums, and works towards success in the graded quizzes, as opposed to a passive participant who just watches the lectures.
