# Here’s what helped me go from “aspiring programmer” to actually landing a job in the field.

## 1\. Developing a Growth Mindset

In 2012, Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck coined the term “[growth mindset](https://hbr.org/2016/01/what-having-a-growth-mindset-actually-means).” ^228d9b

Essentially, Dweck explains that there are two types of mindsets — a fixed mindset and a growth mindset.

Let’s say you’re faced with a problem that is a bit too difficult for you — when you get stuck, what is your initial response like?

Do you feel anxious, or like giving up because you aren’t too smart to solve it?

Or… do you feel like you just haven’t solved it yet. You’ll get there eventually, with a bit more preparation.

If you fall into the first category, you have what Dweck describes as the fixed mindset. A person with a fixed mindset believes that traits like talent and intelligence are inherent. That you either have “it” or you don’t.

Let’s go back to Dylan’s story.

As the fast learner, the kid who got good grades without even trying, Dylan barely made mistakes.

He was the perfect poster child in school, who was constantly complimented for having “good brains” and being smarter than everyone else.

So…what do you think happened when for the first time in his life, this guy tried to learn to code, and initially struggled?

When he browsed the web for answers and strangers, random people on the Internet were able to write programs he barely understood?

When he struggled to perform the most basic tasks without running into errors?

I’ll tell you what happened.

Dylan went into fight or flight mode. He got frustrated. He decided that programming just wasn’t for him.

You see, Dylan embodies the fixed mindset. He thrives in environments that validate him, and breaks down at the mere prospect of failure.

And for the longest time, I was like this too.

When I first tried learning to code, I thought that there were two types of people in the world — people who were cut out for programming, and people who weren’t.

It turns out I was right.

The people who are cut out for programming, however, aren’t smarter or more talented than you.

They just have the ability to accept that learning how to code from scratch is something that requires effort and patience. That it cannot be mastered overnight.

> In other words, they have the **growth mindset**.

The growth mindset means that you see your programming ability as something that can be cultivated by effort. When you fail to learn a concept or run into an error, you don’t see that failure as a way to describe yourself.

Rather, you see it as an opportunity to learn and grow.

For many of us, the growth mindset does not come naturally.

When I first started learning to code, I would struggle with simple problems that I saw my peers solve in minutes.

This led me to question my intelligence and doubt my aptitude for the field.

However, over time, I realized that programming wasn’t like the other subjects we’re taught in school.

Learning to code isn’t like memorizing a textbook for an exam. You can’t spend a few weeks studying it and expect to build full-stack applications after completing a course.

It is a lifelong endeavor that never ends — an exercise that needs to be repeated over and over again, making little improvements with every hour you spend on it.

I like to think of it as going to the gym, or riding a bike. You don’t build muscle overnight after doing a single workout at the gym. You need to show up every week and repeat the action for days on end until you become better at it.

And if you skip a workout or don’t show up for a month, you end up losing progress and having to start over.

Treat programming like a workout.

It can take months to see any visible signs of progress, but showing up consistently and focusing on the process is the only way to improve.

## 2\. Turn Programming Into a Daily Habit

Now that we’ve established that consistency is key when learning to code, how do you turn this into a habit that is repeated enough times to actually see progress?

Learning to code is difficult. And as humans, [research](https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinebeaton/2017/02/22/new-research-shows-that-were-wired-to-take-the-path-of-least-resistance/?sh=46c30e3966d3) shows that our brains are wired to take the easy way out.

So… how do you fight the urge to take the path of least resistance and convince yourself to code every single day?

Sure, it’s easy to stick to your goal of becoming a programmer at the beginning, when you’re motivated. The hard part is staying on track when you start getting frustrated at seeing no visible signs of progress.

Something that helped me make programming a daily habit is a tip provided by James Clear in his bestselling book [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits).

In this book, James Clear states that habits are formed when you repeat something often enough that it becomes a part of your daily life.

To turn any action into a daily habit, he recommends setting an “**_implementation intention._**”

## Implementation Intentions

Implementation intentions allow you to be really specific about what you’re going to do, when you’re going to do it, and where you’re going to do it.

For example, instead of saying — “I’m going to learn programming”, say “I’m going to code every day from 11am to 4pm at the café near my house.”

This implementation intention is specific to me, but you can create a similar one for yourself and follow through with it.

An implementation intention like this will ensure that you make coding a part of your daily routine and stick to it, even on the days when you’re just not feeling it.

Another tip that I found useful is called [**_temptation bundling_**](https://jamesclear.com/temptation-bundling).

## Temptation Bundling

This is the action of combining something that you have to do with something that you enjoy doing, in order to turn it into a daily habit.

For example, most of us find it difficult and unpleasant to go to the gym. However, we love watching Netflix and listening to music.

If you combine the action of watching your favorite TV show with the task of working out every evening, you can trick your brain into looking forward to exercising.

As a coffee enthusiast, I would only allow myself an iced latte if I was programming, which made me look forward to the action of opening my laptop and writing code.

This helped me get out of bed and code everyday, eventually turning this into a daily habit that I grew to enjoy.
